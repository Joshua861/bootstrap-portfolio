              <p>Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is a
                highly
                contentious issue that raises several moral, ethical, and
                practical
                concerns. At its core, it involves the state taking the life of
                a person
                as punishment for a crime they have been convicted of. The act
                of carrying
                out a death sentence is referred to as an "execution," and a
                prisoner who
                is awaiting execution is often referred to as being
                "on death row."</p>

              <h2 id="against">Against the death penalty</h2>
              <p>
                <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/issues/death-penalty">There
                  are
                  numerous compelling arguments against using the death penalty</a>
                as a
                form of punishment. One of the most fundamental of these is the
                belief
                that killing another human being is fundamentally immoral. This
                belief is
                based on the idea that <a href="#rights">all individuals have an
                  inherent
                  right to life and that the state should not have the authority
                  to take
                  away that right.</a>
                <br>
                <br> Another major objection to the death penalty is that it is
                inherently
                flawed and can result in the execution of innocent people. This
                is a
                tragic and unacceptable result, as there is no way to reverse it
                once an
                execution has occurred. The death penalty is often more costly
                than life
                imprisonment due to the extra legal steps taken to prevent
                executing
                innocent people. <br>
                <br>
                <a
                  href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/13363/deterrence-and-the-death-penalty">Critics
                  further say that the death penalty is ineffective in deterring
                  crime</a>
                and that the resources necessary to administer it may be better
                spent on
                improving other aspects of the criminal justice system. The
                existing
                methods of execution in the United States, such as lethal
                injection and
                electrocution, have been widely condemned as cruel and barbaric.
                Furthermore, the protracted periods of time that offenders spend
                on death
                row might also be regarded as overly cruel and brutal. <br>
                <br> Moreover, <a
                  href="https://files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/legacy/documents/DonohueCTStudy.pdf">one
                  study</a> showed that the death penalty disproportionately
                affects
                minority groups and the poor, who are more likely to be
                sentenced to death
                than those who are wealthier or from a different race. This
                raises
                significant concerns about the fairness and impartiality of the
                criminal
                justice system. Many argue that alternative forms of punishment,
                such as
                life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, are more
                humane and
                effective, as they still provide a form of punishment while also
                allowing
                for the possibility of rehabilitation. <br>
                <br> A <a
                  href="https://files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/legacy/documents/WashingtonCosts.pdf">study</a>
                found defense costs were about three times as high in
                death-penalty cases
                and prosecution costs were as much as four times higher than for
                non-death
                penalty cases. <br>
                <br> Nations that carry out the most executions are frequently
                those whose
                judicial systems are under scrutiny for issues of fairness and
                impartiality. The three nations with the highest number of
                executions in
                2012 – China, Iran, and Iraq – have all been criticized for
                imposing death
                sentences in a manner that lacks transparency. <br>

                  study</a> found that the death penalty may be more expensive
                to use.
                Death sentences cost Oregon taxpayers an average of $2.3
                million,
                including jail costs. When state jail costs are excluded, the
                discrepancy
                is even more pronounced. The analysis also discovered that the
                expense of
                the death sentence increased over time, from $274,209 in the
                1980s to
                $1,783,148 in the 2000s. <br>

                <br>
                <br> Another argument against the death penalty is that reformed
                prisoners
                have the potential to do a lot of good for the world. This is
                exemplified
                by the story of people like Nicky Cruz, who was found guilty of
                murder but
                went on to become a Christian evangelist and improved the lives
                of many
                young people. He's not the only one, many other examples like
                Stanley
                "Tookie" Williams, co-founder of the Crips street gang, who
                became an
                anti-gang activist and children's author while serving a life
                sentence.
                Or, like John Newton, a former slave trader who wrote the famous
                hymn
                "Amazing Grace" after turning to Christianity and dedicating the
                rest of
                his life to abolitionist causes. <br>
              </p>
              <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block"  src="punishment_files/cruz.jpg">
              <p>
                <br> These stories serve as a powerful examples of how even
                those who have
                committed heinous crimes can turn their lives around and make a
                positive
                impact on society. Reformed prisoners can serve as powerful
                advocates for
                change, not only within the criminal justice system but also in
                their
                communities. They have a unique perspective on the issues of
                crime and
                punishment, and can provide valuable insight into the causes of
                criminal
                behavior and potential solutions. They also serve as role models
                for other
                offenders, showing that change is possible and that a life of
                crime is not
                a predetermined fate. <br>
                <br> Furthermore, reformed prisoners can also contribute to
                society by
                participating in programs such as restorative justice, where
                they can take
                responsibility for their actions and make amends to their
                victims and the
                community. This not only helps the offender to take
                responsibility for
                their actions but also allows the victims and the community to
                find
                closure and move forward.
              </p>
              <h2 id="for"> For the death penalty </h2>
              <p> The argument that "the punishment should fit the crime" is
                often put
                forth as a justification for the use of the death penalty,
                particularly in
                cases of heinous crimes such as murder. Proponents of this
                viewpoint argue
                that when someone takes the life of another person, they forfeit
                their own
                right to life. Therefore, they should be subject to capital
                punishment.
                <br>
              </p>
              <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block"  src="punishment_files/crime.png">
              <p>
                <br> Another argument for the death penalty is that it serves as
                a form of
                just punishment for serious crimes and provides a sense of
                closure for the
                victims' families. It's also believed that executing a murderer
                may deter
                others from committing similar crimes in the future.
                Additionally, by
                permanently removing dangerous criminals from society, the death
                penalty
                is seen as a way to protect the public from future harm. <br>
                <br> Furthermore, supporters of the death penalty argue that the
                benefits
                to society of deterring and removing killers outweigh the
                minimal chance
                of making the wrong decision. They also argue that the death
                penalty is
                cost-effective when compared to life imprisonment. They believe
                that, when
                all the costs of an appeal are taken into account, it would be
                less
                expensive to carry out the death penalty. <br>
                <br> Critics of the death penalty argue that it is inhumane,
                fallible, and
                does not effectively deter crime. There are legitimate concerns
                about the
                fairness and impartiality of the criminal justice system. The
                death
                penalty disproportionately affects minority groups and the poor,
                which
                raises significant concerns about its application. <br>
              </p>
              <h2 id="christ">Christian views on the death penalty</h2>
              <p> Christian views on the death penalty are varied and complex.
                Different
                denominations and individuals hold different beliefs. <br>
                <br> Some Christians believe that the death penalty is morally
                justifiable
                and that it serves as a form of retribution for heinous crimes
                such as
                murder. They may cite Old Testament passages, such as
                "an eye for an eye,"
                as justification for the death penalty. Another example is that
                in Genesis
                9:6 it says, "Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his
                blood be
                shed, for God made man in his own image." <br>
                <br> However, other Christians argue that the death penalty is
                not in line
                with the teachings of Jesus and the overall message of love and
                redemption
                in the New Testament. They may point to Jesus' teachings on
                forgiveness
                and non-violence as a reason to oppose the death penalty. <br>
                <br> The Catholic Church has historically supported the use of
                the death
                penalty in certain cases, such as in self-defence or in cases of
                "grave
                and prolonged danger to the safety of the people." However, in
                recent
                years, the Church has shifted its position and now calls for the
                abolition
                of the death penalty, stating that "the dignity of the human
                person is not
                lost even after the commission of very serious crimes." <br>
                <br> Many protestant denominations have taken a similar stance
                and have
                spoken out against the death penalty as well. <br>
                <br> It's worth noting that while some religious individuals and
                groups
                may have specific views on the death penalty, the issue is
                highly complex
                and nuanced, and there are valid arguments on both sides. Some
                religious
                figures and leaders have spoken out against the death penalty
                and
                advocated for alternatives to the death penalty, such as life
                imprisonment
                without the possibility of parole. <br>
              </p>
              <h2 id="jewish">Jewish views on the death penalty</h2>
              <p> Traditionally, Jewish law has recognised the authority of the
                secular
                government to impose the death penalty, and it has been used as
                punishment
                for certain crimes such as murder, idolatry, and certain sexual
                offences.
                The Talmud, which is a central text of Rabbinic Judaism,
                contains a number
                of passages discussing the use of the death penalty. Jewish law
                traditionally sets out a number of strict requirements that must
                be met in
                order for a death sentence to be carried out. <br>
                <br> However, in recent years, many Jewish scholars and leaders
                have
                spoken out against the death penalty, arguing that it is no
                longer morally
                justifiable in modern society. Some have pointed to the high
                risk of error
                and the possibility of executing an innocent person, as well as
                the idea
                that the death penalty is not a deterrent to crime. <br>
                <br> Additionally, many Jews believe in the value of
                rehabilitation and
                redemption, and some argue that the death penalty does not leave
                room for
                either the offender or the victim's family to find forgiveness
                and
                healing. They also point out the Jewish tradition of repentance,
                Tikkun
                Olam, and the principle of preserving human life, Pikuach
                Nefesh, as
                reasons to abolish the death penalty. <br>
                <br> As with other religious groups, it's worth noting that
                Jewish views
                on the death penalty are diverse and nuanced, and there are
                valid
                arguments on both sides of the issue. Some Jewish organizations
                and
                leaders have advocated for alternatives to the death penalty,
                such as life
                imprisonment without the possibility of parole. <br>
              </p>
              <h2 id="mine">My views and conclusion</h2>
              <p>In summary, a life sentence in prison is a more morally and
                financially
                sound option than the death penalty. It allows for the
                possibility of
                exoneration in the event of wrongful conviction, and also offers
                opportunities for rehabilitation and reintegration into society.
                Furthermore, the death penalty raises ethical concerns regarding
                the
                state's authority to take lives, and the methods used in
                execution can be
                deemed inhumane. In contrast, a life sentence does not have the
                same moral
                implications.</p>
